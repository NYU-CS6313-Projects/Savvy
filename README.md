# Savvy

Savvy is a tool for assessing educational gamesâ€™ learning impact. In this demo we are using a dataset provided by Melissa Biles from NYU's CREATE (Consortium for Research and Evaluation of Advanced Technologies in Education) lab, pertaining to the "Noobs vs. Leets" educational video game.

A live demo can be found [here](http://nyu-cs6313-projects.github.io/Savvy).
